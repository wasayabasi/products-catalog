Product Catalog Dataset Assistant
This repository contains scripts to build and interact with a Product Catalog Dataset Assistant using LangChain and Streamlit.

Overview
The Product Catalog Dataset Assistant is designed to help users interactively query and retrieve information from a product catalog dataset using natural language.

Features
Interactive Interface: Utilizes Streamlit to provide a user-friendly chat interface.
Natural Language Processing: Uses LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to process and respond to user queries.
Dataset Specific: Focuses on answering questions related to the product catalog dataset only.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Before running the assistant, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-catalog-assistant.git
cd product-catalog-assistant
Install dependencies from requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setting up Environment Variables
To securely use the OpenAI API, set your API key as an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
Replace "your_openai_api_key" with your actual OpenAI API key.

Running the Assistant
Start the Streamlit app to launch the assistant:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run catalog_assistant_interface.py
The app will open in your default web browser. Enter queries related to the product catalog dataset to interact with the assistant.

Files and Structure
catalog_agent_setup.py: Contains the setup for the LangChain agent using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model and the product catalog dataset.
catalog_assistant_interface.py: Implements the Streamlit interface for users to interact with the assistant.
requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies required for running the assistant.
Example Usage
User enters a query about the product catalog dataset.
The assistant processes the query using natural language processing.
The assistant displays the response related to the query in the chat interface.
Notes
Ensure to handle sensitive information like API keys securely.
Modify and extend the assistant's functionality as per your specific requirements.
